               configuration in which plasmas can spontaneously transform into
               different self-organized states. Among various states, the
               `quasi-single-helical' (QSH) state has a dominant component for
               the magnetic field and significantly improves confinement. Many
               theoretical and experimental efforts have investigated the
               transitions among different states. This paper employs the
               multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamic model to study the
               properties of QSH and other states. The stepped-pressure
               equilibrium code (SPEC) is used to compute MHD equilibria for
               the Keda Torus eXperiment (KTX). The toroidal volume of KTX is
               partitioned into two subvolumes by an internal transport
               barrier. The geometry of this barrier is adjusted to achieve
               force balance across the interface, ensuring that the plasma in
               each subvolume is force-free and that magnetic helicity is
               conserved. By varying the parameters, we generate distinct
               self-organized states in KTX. Our findings highlight the crucial
               role of magnetic helicity in shaping these states. In states
               with low magnetic helicity in both subvolumes, the plasma
               exhibits axisymmetric behavior. With increasing core helicity,
               the plasma gradually transforms from an axisymmetric state to a
               double-axis helical state and finally to a single-helical-axis
               state. Elevated core magnetic helicity leads to a more
               pronounced dominant mode of the boundary magnetic field and a
               reduced core magnetic shear. This is consistent with previous
               experimental and numerical results in other RFP devices. We find
               a linear relationship between the plasma current and helicity in
               different self-organized states. Our findings suggest that KTX
               may enter the QSH state when the toroidal current reaches 0.72
               MA. This study demonstrates that the stellarator equilibrium
               code SPEC unveils crucial RFP equilibrium properties, rendering
               it applicable to a broad range of RFP devices and other toroidal
               configurations.",
