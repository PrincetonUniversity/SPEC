The calculation of the Hessian in SPEC can be verified in slab geometry to machine precision following the attach PDF document. The SPEC input files used for verification can be found in the TestCases folder, namely G1V02L0Fi.001.sp and G1V05L0Fi.001.sp are used. When the input flag LHmatrix=T, the Hessian matrix as calculated by SPEC is saved in a '.ext.GF.ma' file that can be easily read using, e.g., the matlab utilities (read_spec_hessian.m).
