TESTCASES_COMPARISON
--------------------

In this directory, the output of SPEC is compared between a local constraint (either L0 or L1) and the current constraint (L3) for some testcases proposed in SPEC Inputfile directory. We proceed as follows:

	1. Compile the master version of SPEC and copy it in this directory with filename "xspec_master"
	   $ git checkout master
	   $ make
	   $ cp xspec Inputfiles/Verification/currentconstraint/TestCases_Comparison/xspec_master

	2. Compile the current constraint branch of SPEC and copy it in this directory
	   $ git checkout CurrentConstraint
	   $ make
	   $ cp xspec_master Inputfiles/Verification/currentconstraint/TestCases_Comparison/.

	3. Run TestCases with run_local script (~20 minutes). This will run all L0 and L1 input files with xspec.
	   $ ./run_local

	4. Run L3 files with run_global script (~20 minutes). This will run all L3 files with xspec
	   $ ./run_global

	5. Run TestCases with run_master script (~20 minutes). This will set the reference to which files will be compared to.
	   $ ./run_master

	5. Compare both outputs using Matlab script
	   $ matlab -nodesktop
	   $ compare_tests


For each testcase, outputs (from point 3., 4. and 5.) should be the same, since the same physical system is described (once constrained by (mu, psip) or (iota, oita), and once by the toroidal current). compare_tests.m will evaluate the force difference between two cases. If all values are small, outputs can be considered the same (Note that due to resolution, df will not necessarily be 1E-16 but some order of magnitude more).
