## Comparison of Lfindzero=1 and Lfindzero=2

In this directory we propose to compare the equilibrium found when using the force computed numerically (`>>> ls *001*`) to the one computed analytically (`>>> ls *002*`). Three cases are provided:

* *G1V05L3Fi*: Slab geometry, five plasma volumes, fixed boundary. Execution time: less than 1s 
* *G2V03L3Fi*: Cylindrical geometry, 3 plasma volumes, fixed boundary. Execution time: less than 1s 
* *G3V08L3Fr*: Toroidal geometry, 8 plasma volumes and 1 vacuum region, free boundary. Execution time: ~3000s for .001, ~1120s for .002
