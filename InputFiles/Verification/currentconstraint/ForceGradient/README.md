##Force gradient verification

In this directory, tests are proposed in slab and cylindrical geometry to verify the convergence of the force gradient **at fixed toroidal current** (Lconstraint=3). For the complete derivation and results, see the attached file *ForceGradient\_CurrentConstraint.pdf*. 

* In *SlabFreeBound\_Comparison*, the convergence study between the analytical force gradient and the implemented force gradient in the case of a free boundary slab plasma can be reproduced.
* In *ScrewPinch\_Comparison*,  the convergence study between the analytical force gradient and the implemented force gradient in the case of a fixed boundary cylindrical plasma can be reproduced.
* In *Torus\_Comparison*,  the convergence study between a finite difference estimate of the force gradient and the implemented force gradient in the case of a free boundary rotating ellipse can be reproduced.
