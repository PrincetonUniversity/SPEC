This is a test case designed to verify that free-boundary SPEC works for a force-free plasma (finite current, no pressure). We can verify the analytical prediction (Freidberg, ideal MHD, Edition 2014, page 150, Equation 6.90) for the vertical field required to maintain a plasma (circular cross-section, large aspect ratio) of given size "a" at a position "R", given the toroidal current "I". So BV=BV(R,a) given I. We can then scan BV by carefully modifying Vns in the SPEC input and extract the equilibrium position and size, R and a, obtained from SPEC for each BV. Then we can compare BV_SPEC to BV_Freidberg given (R,a). 

Attached are different input files with different BV values, a matlab script that compares the SPEC output to the Freidberg prediction, and a plot of this exercise, showing very good agreement for a wide range of BV values. Two Poincare plots (for the two extreme values of BV) are attached to show that the plasma is significantly displaced radially in the range of BV values considered. The yellow band in the BV_SPEC-BV_Freidberg plot indicates the order of magnitude of the expected error (namely, of order epsilon^2 where epsilon=a/R) given the expansion in Freidberg's theory.
