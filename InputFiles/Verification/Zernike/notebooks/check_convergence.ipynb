    "This notebook compares the Zernike branch and the master (v2.10) branch. These tests should take less than an hour to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1 Clone and compile\n",
    "To start, please checkout the Zernike branch and the master branch (__v2.10, not the latest master__) in two different folders. The following git commands clone these two branches into a folder `Zernike` and a folder `master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone -b Zernike https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/SPEC.git Zernike\n",

    "\n",
    "After cloning, please compile them seperately as normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2 Dependencies\n",
    "Before running this notebook, one will need to set up the `py_spec` package. __Please use the package in the Zernike branch, not the master branch or pypi branch!!!__ \n",
    "\n",
    "One will need `numpy`, `h5py` and `f90nml` packages. If you haven't installed them, please do so by\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install --user numpy h5py f90nml`\n",
    "\n",
    "Or one can choose to use `conda` to manage the packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can set up the `py_spec` package by the following two means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting the environment before starting Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/Zernike/Utilities/pythontools`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Setting the environment in this Notebook by copying the following commands into a new cell and running them before anything else in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "sys.path.append('/path/to/Zernike/Utilities/pythontools')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can import `py_spec` and relevant objects in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Important: check the version of the `py_spec` package. It should be `0.0.1 Zernike` !!!__"
