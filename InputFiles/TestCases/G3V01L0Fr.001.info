This input file reproduces a 5-field-period stellarator vacuum field as produced by Dommaschk analytical potentials (see Verification folder for more details). The harmonics of B.n on the computational boundary were calculated from the Dommaschk solution and provided to SPEC. Similarly, the linking currents required to run SPEC free-boundary were provided to SPEC. Here LautoiniBn is set to 0 in order to avoid an initial fix-boundary calculation performed to initialize Bns (since here we know that Bns=0). The run takes ~5min with ncpu=2.
