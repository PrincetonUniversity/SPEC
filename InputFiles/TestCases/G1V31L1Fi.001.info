Test case for a slab force-free current sheet with arbitrary poloidal and toroidal extent. The equilibrium current profile follows that of [Loureiro et al, PRL 95, 235003 (2005)]. For rpol=rtor=0.4 the equilbrium is stable (as can be seen by analyzing the Hessian eigenvalues). If one sets rpol=rtor=0.5, the equilibrium is (tearing) unstable. The marginal point should be at 1/sqrt(5).
