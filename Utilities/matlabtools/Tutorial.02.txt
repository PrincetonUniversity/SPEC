%%%%%%%%%%%% Plotting |B| on the boundary surface and on a cross-section %%%%%%%%%%%%


%%% Initial setup %%%

1. Copy the SPEC executable and the input file G3V02L1Fi.001.sp in a directory.
2. Run ./xspec G3V02L1Fi.001 (should take ~10sec for force-balance).
3. Open matlab (e.g., from terminal: matlab -nodesktop)
4. Add path to the Utilities/matlabtools directory: addpath /somepath/Utilities/matlabtools


%%% Matlab analysis %%%

1. Define name of file to analyse:
   
   fname = 'G3V02L1Fi.001.sp.h5';

2. Load output data:

   data = read_spec(fname); 

3. Call ploting routine for |B| on the boundary surface:
   
   plot_spec_modB_boundary(data, 2, 0, 64, 64, 3); 

3. Call ploting routine for |B| on a cross-section for volumes lvol=2 and lvol=1:

   plot_spec_modB(data,2,'d','d','d',1);
   plot_spec_modB(data,1,'d','d','d',0);


%%% More details %%% 

In order to see how to change cross-section, or other ploting options, use the help tool to see the meaning of each input.

Example: help plot_spec_modB

In order to obtain the magnetic field components to use them for other purposes, see routines

 - get_spec_magfield 
 - get_spec_modB
