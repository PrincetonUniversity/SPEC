%%%%%%%%%%%% Plotting rotational transform profiles %%%%%%%%%%%%


%%% Initial setup %%%

1. Copy the SPEC executable and the input file G3V02L1Fi.001.sp in a directory.
2. Open the input file and change the parameter nPpts=0 to e.g. nPpts=1000 (field-line-tracing toroidal transits).
3. Run ./xspec G3V02L1Fi.001 (should take ~10sec for force-balance and ~5min for field-line-tracing).
4. Open matlab (e.g., from terminal: matlab -nodesktop)
5. Add path to the Utilities/matlabtools directory: addpath /somepath/Utilities/matlabtools


%%% Matlab analysis %%%

1. Define name of file to analyse:
   
   fname = 'G3V02L1Fi.001.sp.h5';

2. Load output data from field-line-tracing and magnetic-field-solution:
   
   data = read_spec(fname);
   
3. Call ploting routine for iota versus toroidal flux:
   
   plot_spec_iota(data,'i','f',1);
   
3. Call ploting routine for iota on the ideal-interfaces:

   plot_spec_iotakam(data,'i','f',0);
   

%%% More details %%% 

In order to see how to change cross-section, or other ploting options, use the help tool to see the meaning of each input.

Example: help plot_spec_iota
