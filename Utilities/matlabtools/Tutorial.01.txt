%%%%%%%%%%%% Plotting Poincare sections and ideal interfaces %%%%%%%%%%%%


%%% Initial setup %%%

1. Copy the SPEC executable and the input file G3V02L1Fi.001.sp in a directory.
2. Open the input file and change the parameter nPpts=0 to e.g. nPpts=500 (number of toroidal transits).
3. Run ./xspec G3V02L1Fi.001 (should take ~10sec for force-balance and ~2min for field-line-tracing).
4. Open matlab (e.g., from terminal: matlab -nodesktop)
5. Add path to the Utilities/matlabtools directory: addpath /somepath/Utilities/matlabtools


%%% Matlab analysis %%%

1. Define name of file to analyse:
   
   fname = 'G3V02L1Fi.001.sp.h5';

2. Load output data:

   data = read_spec(fname);

3. Call ploting routine for Poincare section:
   
   plot_spec_poincare(data,1,1,1); 
   
4. Call ploting routine for ideal-interfaces on Poincare section:

   plot_spec_kam(data,1,0);


%%% More details %%% 

In order to see how to change cross-section, or other ploting options, use the help tool to see the meaning of each input.

Example: help plot_spec_poincare
