# The Stepped Pressure Equilibrium Code 

SPEC solves 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria with stepped-pressure profiles. This powerful description doesn't artificially restrict the solution to nested flux surfaces, and admits simulations with islands and chaotic regions. It is a spectral-element code, that finds minimal-plasma-energy states by extremizing the multi-region, relaxed-MHD (MRxMHD) energy functional. 

- There is a [brief description of SPEC](https://theory.pppl.gov/research/research.php?rid=10#h5) on the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory [Theory Department website](https://theory.pppl.gov/). 
- An overview of the algorithm is given in a [Flow Chart](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/SPEC/docs/SPEC_flowchart.pdf).
- A list of publications using SPEC are in our [bibliography section](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/SPEC/citelist)
- Please direct questions/suggestions to [Stuart Hudson](mailto:shudson@pppl.gov?subject=spec).
